## Problem 1. 

Describe the difference between regression and interpolation. Provide a hand-drawn figure to illustrate. In the description, identify the following:
- limitations to both
- R tools available
- best user practices

## Problem 2. 

The following data describes a series of density measurements collected at a range of temperatures. 

|-----------|--|--|--|--|--|--|
|T [&deg; F]|20|25|30|35|40|45|
|D [kg m-3]|1.71|1.39|1.12|0.957|0.841|0.771| 

```{r}
Temp <- c(20,25,30,35,40,45)
Dens <- c(1.71,1.39,1.12,0.957,0.841,0.771) 
```


Imagine you were given the following table above and you did not have R. Use the linear interpolation equation to estimate density at 32.9â„‰. (Do your calculations in the chunk below). 

```{r}

```

Now using R functions show the resulting plots for linear, spline, nearest, and constant interpolation.

```{r}

```

For this dataset, what method would you recommend?
 
## Problem 3.

In engineering applications, steam tables are often used to determine thermodynamic properties of water and steam at various temperatures and pressures. You are tasked with interpolating values from a steam table to find the specific enthalpy of  water at a given temperature using interpolation.

A steam table is provided for saturated water by temperature in the data folder.

```{r}
steam <- read_csv(file = "data/saturated_by_temperature_V1.5.csv", skip = 6)
```

Using linear interpolation, what is the enthalpy of liquid water at 370.5 &deg;C? 

```{r}

```

What method of interpolation would improve upon this interpolated estimate? Use this method to improve upon your linear estimate

```{r}

```
